# Color output plan

## Goal

Generate a six-color mountain puzzle whose printable surface marks:

- forest in dark green;
- exposed rock and other ground in warm gray;
- snow and ice in off-white.
- permanent water in blue.
- prominent roads in ochre.
- buildings in warm tan.

The first reference case is the existing Mount Rainier example. The single-color
STL files must remain available. The 3MF file becomes the main color output.

## Product choices

### Use mapped land cover, not elevation alone

Elevation can suggest a snow line or tree line, but it cannot tell forest from
rock. The first version should use ESA WorldCover 2021 at 10 m resolution:

- class 10, tree cover: forest;
- class 60, bare or sparse vegetation: rock;
- class 70, snow and ice: snow;
- class 80, permanent water bodies: water;
- all other classes: rock in the color mode.

OpenStreetMap adds motorway, trunk, primary, and secondary road geometry after
the land-cover mask is clean. It also adds rivers, streams, canals, and mapped
water areas. Linear features use smooth vector paths rather than raster cells.
Higher road and waterway classes get wider print lines. The generator skips
tunnels and keeps bridges visible. The default primary-road width is 0.7 mm;
motorway and trunk lines are wider, while secondary roads and links are
narrower. Dense-road adjustment can reduce those widths toward a printable 0.4
mm floor. If no visible prominent road crosses the model, the generator falls
back to paths, footways, bridleways, tracks, and cycleways. Trails never appear
on top of a road network. A separate waterway coverage cutoff always keeps
rivers and canals, then adds the longest streams while their estimated printed
area stays within the chosen share of the model. The default is 12%. A 0%
cutoff gives major waterways only, while 100% keeps every mapped stream. Lakes
and other mapped water areas stay unchanged.

The map is static, so snow means mapped snow or ice rather than current seasonal
snow. WorldCover supplies broad water coverage while OpenStreetMap supplies
sharper water boundaries and narrower waterways. A later version can add dated
Sentinel-2 imagery for seasonal snow.

### Paint only the visible terrain surface

The terrain surface gets forest, rock, snow, water, or roads. Raised building
roofs and walls use a separate building material. Piece side walls and the
underside use the rock filament. This keeps the pieces strong and cuts filament
changes compared with making each color a solid volume.

The default palette is:

| Surface | Preview color | Suggested filament |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forest | `#28543A` | dark green matte PLA |
| Rock | `#7C7468` | stone or warm gray matte PLA |
| Snow | `#F4F3EC` | natural white matte PLA |
| Water | `#2F76B5` | medium blue matte PLA |
| Road | `#D8A33C` | ochre or amber matte PLA |
| Building | `#B8A890` | warm tan or architectural gray PLA |

The colors are labels, not fixed filament brands. Bambu Studio should let the
user map each label to an AMS slot.

### Keep color regions printable

Land-cover rasters contain small, noisy patches that do not print well. Before
painting the mesh:

1. resample the land-cover grid in assembled puzzle coordinates;
2. remove isolated regions below a configurable printed size;
3. close one-cell holes;
4. assign each top triangle one flat color from its center point.

Start with a 1.2 mm minimum patch size for a 0.4 mm nozzle. The UI should explain
that smaller patches add filament changes and may vanish in the sliced output.

## Data and Rust model

Add these core types:

```text
SurfaceClass = Forest | Rock | Snow | Water | Road | Building
SurfacePalette = colors and filament labels
SurfaceField = classified raster plus indexed vector lines and areas
ColorOutputSpec = enabled, palette, minimum patch size, side color
```

The API fetches land-cover tiles and caches Overpass road, trail, water, and
building responses beside the elevation cache. The job manifest records each
data set, license, source URL, and class mapping.

Mesh generation classifies top triangles in global assembled coordinates. This
keeps color boundaries continuous across neighboring pieces. Bottom and side
triangles always receive the chosen side color.

## 3MF output

Use the standard 3MF Materials and Properties Extension. Add one color group
with the six palette entries, then attach a flat property to each triangle
with `pid` and equal `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` values. Keep geometry and color data
separate in the Rust mesh model.

Do not write Bambu-only project data in the first pass. A standards-based 3MF
is easier to test and still leaves room for a later Bambu project export.

## Website changes

Add a **Color terrain** section below the relief controls:

- Off / Rock–forest–snow–water–road–building mode;
- six editable color swatches;
- minimum color patch size;
- road output toggle and print width;
- adaptive road-width toggle for dense maps;
- OpenStreetMap water toggle;
- side and underside color;
- a note that snow is not live and fine map features remain print-width limited.

The terrain preview should use the same class raster as the export. Add a small
legend and coverage figures, such as `Forest 51% · Rock 31% · Snow 18%`.
Generation should still work if land-cover data fails: show a clear warning and
offer a rock-only export rather than silently inventing classes.

## Delivery stages

### 1. Classification foundation

- Add the surface types and color settings.
- Build a small in-memory class raster.
- Test deterministic classification, filtering, and seam continuity.

### 2. Land-cover provider

- Fetch ESA WorldCover data and cache OpenStreetMap vector overlays for the selected bounds.
- Reproject and sample it beside the elevation field.
- Record source and license details in the manifest.

### 3. Color 3MF

- Add standard 3MF color resources and triangle properties.
- Keep STL output unchanged.
- Add XML and archive tests for every material reference.

### 4. Preview and controls

- Add the color settings, legend, and coverage figures.
- Render the exact exported mask over the relief preview.
- Show missing-data and excessive-color-change warnings.

### 5. Print validation

- Open the Mount Rainier 3MF in the current Bambu Studio release.
- Confirm six named colors map to the intended filaments.
- Confirm all nine pieces stay manifold and retain their snug seams.
- Slice a representative center piece and inspect its top layers.
- Print a small test piece before treating the palette and 1.2 mm patch size as
  final.

## Acceptance checks

- Mount Rainier shows connected green forest low on the mountain, gray exposed
  ground above the tree line, white snow or ice near the summit and glaciers,
  and blue where permanent water is mapped.
- Color boundaries continue across puzzle seams.
- Road widths follow the selected print width and road class.
- Roads, trails, and waterways remain smooth when mesh detail increases.
- The web preview and 3MF triangle classes match.
- The 3MF opens with six usable colors and no mesh repair.
- Each piece remains one closed solid.
- Single-color STL output remains unchanged.
- A missing land-cover tile never produces false color without a warning.
